---

## Windows System Architecture

1. **What is Windows System Architecture?**
   - Windows System Architecture is a layered structure that separates tasks into user mode and kernel mode, ensuring security and stability.

2. **What are the two main modes in Windows?**
   - **User Mode** and **Kernel Mode**.

3. **Why does Windows separate tasks into User Mode and Kernel Mode?**
   - To prevent applications from directly accessing critical system resources, improving security and stability.

4. **What is the primary difference between User Mode and Kernel Mode?**
   - User Mode has restricted access to system resources, while Kernel Mode has full access to hardware and critical system components.

5. **What happens if an application crashes in User Mode?**
   - The crash is isolated to the application itself, and it doesn’t typically affect the whole system.

6. **What happens if a process crashes in Kernel Mode?**
   - A Kernel Mode crash can result in a system-wide failure, often leading to a **Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)**.

## User Mode

7. **What is User Mode?**
   - User Mode is the **least privileged mode** where applications and services operate, unable to directly access system resources or hardware.

8. **What components run in User Mode?**
   - Applications, environment subsystems (e.g., Win32 API), and system libraries (DLLs).

9. **What is process isolation in User Mode?**
   - Each User Mode process runs in its own **virtual address space**, preventing one process from affecting another.

10. **What is the Win32 Subsystem?**
    - It provides the interface for running Windows applications and handling system calls.

11. **Can User Mode applications access hardware directly?**
    - No, User Mode applications must use APIs to request hardware access from Kernel Mode.

12. **What is a system call?**
    - A system call is a way for user-mode applications to request services from the operating system in kernel mode.

13. **What are DLLs in User Mode?**
    - DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) provide reusable code modules for various applications, reducing duplication.

14. **What is the role of system libraries like kernel32.dll?**
    - They provide essential services and APIs for User Mode applications, such as memory management and file handling.

15. **What is Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)?**
    - WSL allows native Linux binaries to run on Windows, providing a Linux-like environment in User Mode.

16. **How do threads differ from processes in User Mode?**
    - A process is an instance of a program, while a thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process.

17. **What is thread scheduling?**
    - The process by which the operating system allocates CPU time to each thread in User Mode.

18. **What are environment subsystems?**
    - APIs or environments that provide specific functionalities, like the Win32 API or .NET Framework.

19. **What is virtual memory in User Mode?**
    - Virtual memory allows each process to believe it has its own large, continuous block of memory, even though it's sharing resources with other processes.

20. **How does User Mode interact with Kernel Mode?**
    - Through **system calls**, User Mode processes request services from Kernel Mode.

## Kernel Mode

21. **What is Kernel Mode?**
    - Kernel Mode is the most privileged mode, where the operating system core, device drivers, and hardware interface layers reside.

22. **What is the Windows Executive?**
    - It is a set of services in Kernel Mode that manages higher-level operations like I/O management and security.

23. **What is the role of the Windows Kernel?**
    - The kernel handles low-level tasks like process scheduling, exception handling, and synchronization.

24. **What is the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)?**
    - The HAL is a layer that abstracts the hardware details from the kernel, allowing Windows to run on different hardware platforms.

25. **What are device drivers?**
    - Device drivers are software that allow the operating system to communicate with hardware devices like network cards or storage devices.

26. **What is the role of the Memory Manager in Kernel Mode?**
    - It handles memory allocation, paging, and virtual memory management.

27. **What is the Object Manager in Kernel Mode?**
    - The Object Manager creates, manages, and tracks objects like files, processes, and threads.

28. **What is thread scheduling in Kernel Mode?**
    - It manages how CPU time is allocated to threads across all processes running on the system.

29. **What is the Security Reference Monitor (SRM)?**
    - It enforces security policies for accessing system resources, ensuring proper access control.

30. **How does the Kernel handle exceptions?**
    - It manages hardware and software-generated exceptions, ensuring proper recovery or system shutdown.

31. **What is a Kernel Mode trap?**
    - A trap is a mechanism by which control transfers from user mode to kernel mode, usually in response to a system call.

32. **What are IRQLs (Interrupt Request Levels)?**
    - IRQLs prioritize interrupts to ensure that high-priority tasks, like hardware communication, are handled before lower-priority tasks.

33. **What is the I/O Manager in Kernel Mode?**
    - The I/O Manager handles communication between hardware devices and the operating system, facilitating reading/writing to files, networks, etc.

34. **What is direct memory access (DMA)?**
    - DMA allows hardware devices to directly access system memory without involving the CPU, improving performance for tasks like data transfer.

35. **How does the Kernel Mode manage process scheduling?**
    - The kernel uses a **preemptive scheduling algorithm** to allocate CPU time efficiently across multiple processes.

36. **What is paging in Kernel Mode?**
    - Paging is the process of swapping parts of a program’s memory to and from disk when system memory is low.

37. **What is an interrupt in Kernel Mode?**
    - An interrupt is a signal sent by hardware or software indicating that an event needs immediate attention from the kernel.

38. **What is a Kernel Mode driver?**
    - A Kernel Mode driver has full access to hardware and system memory and operates at a higher privilege level than user-mode drivers.

39. **What is a Windows file system driver (FSD)?**
    - An FSD enables the operating system to interact with file systems (e.g., NTFS, FAT).

40. **How does the kernel communicate with device drivers?**
    - The kernel uses **I/O request packets (IRPs)** to send requests to device drivers.

## General Questions

41. **What is a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)?**
    - A BSOD occurs when a critical error happens in Kernel Mode, causing the system to halt and display an error message.

42. **What is system call overhead?**
    - The time and resources required to switch from User Mode to Kernel Mode and back, due to system calls.

43. **What is privilege separation in Windows?**
    - Privilege separation refers to the division between User Mode and Kernel Mode to protect system stability and security.

44. **What is a context switch?**
    - A context switch occurs when the CPU switches from executing one process or thread to another, often involving a switch between User Mode and Kernel Mode.

45. **What is a hardware interrupt?**
    - A hardware interrupt is a signal from a hardware device that needs immediate attention from the operating system, often handled in Kernel Mode.

46. **What is exception handling in Windows?**
    - Exception handling is the process of managing and responding to errors or exceptions in both User Mode and Kernel Mode.

47. **What is a virtual address in Windows?**
    - A virtual address is an address used by applications to access memory, translated by the operating system into physical memory locations.

48. **What is a system API?**
    - A system API is a set of functions provided by the operating system that applications can use to perform tasks like file handling, memory allocation, or I/O operations.

49. **How does Windows ensure security between User Mode and Kernel Mode?**
    - By enforcing privilege separation, requiring system calls for hardware access, and using the **Security Reference Monitor (SRM)**.

50. **What is a protected process in Windows?**
    - A protected process has enhanced security, preventing tampering or interference from other processes, especially in User Mode.
